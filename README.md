🚀 A Web3 options gambling game built on Solana using Nuxt.js, where users can predict the price movement of Solana (SOL) within the next minute and win rewards. This template provides a ready-to-use framework for launching a decentralized price prediction game on Solana.
## 🎮 Features

    🔥 Live SOL/USDC Price Chart (Powered by Pyth Network)
    🕒 1-Minute Prediction Rounds (Users bet on price direction)
    💰 Automatic Payouts (Smart contract handles rewards)
    🏦 House Edge & Treasury (Sustainable revenue model)
    🔐 Solana Wallet Integration (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
    ⚡ Fast & Scalable (Built with Nuxt.js & Solana Web3.js)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

    Frontend: Nuxt.js (Vue.js, TailwindCSS)
    Blockchain: Solana (Rust, Anchor framework)
    Smart Contract: Solana Program handling bets & payouts
    Live Data: Pyth Network Oracles for real-time SOL/USD price
    Wallet Connection: Solana Wallet Adapter

## 📌 How It Works

    Users place a bet (Call/Put) predicting if SOL price will go up or down in the next minute.
    Betting locks after 30 seconds and price is recorded.
    After 1 minute, the contract checks if the price went up or down.
    Winners get paid automatically; losers forfeit their bet.
    New round starts automatically every minute!
